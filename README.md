# React News App

This is a simple news app built with React that fetches and displays the latest news articles. The app fetches news from the NewsAPI and displays it in a clean and responsive grid layout. It also handles loading states and error messages.

## Features

- Fetches news articles from the NewsAPI.
- Displays news articles with images, titles, descriptions, and links to read more.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Displays loading message while fetching data.
- Error handling for API requests.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the NewsAPI.
- **NewsAPI**: A free API to get the latest news articles.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lRennan/React-News.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd react-news-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Add your **NewsAPI key** in the `App.js` file where the API request is made:

   ```javascript
   const response = await axios.get("https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines", {
     params: {
       country: "br",
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     },
   });
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual NewsAPI key. You can get a free API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, it will display the latest news articles for Brazil. Each article will include:
- An image (if available).
- The article's title.
- A brief description.
- A link to the full article.
